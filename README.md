# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning methods I've been implementing.

Might not offer much new stuff as other libraries already exist and are well tested, but it is always good to implement methods to better understand them, hence why I do it.

Some methods use the library CVXOPT, Python Software for Convex Optimization, that is not part of the standard Python, but is included in Anaconda for example.
