Clustering methods

Only two implemented for the moment
  - k-means clustering
  - Gaussian mixture solved by EM.
  
      1) For the moment, only spherical covariance, more to come shortly
      2) Need to improve probability calculation using log, to be done very shortly as for the Bayes classifiers cases
