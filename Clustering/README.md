Clustering methods

Only two implemented for the moment
  - k-means clustering
  - Gaussian mixture solved by EM.
  
        1) For the moment, spherical and full covariances implemented, diagonal to come shortly
        2) Need to improve probability calculation using log, to be done very shortly as for the Bayes classifiers cases
        3) The full covariance case still need some testing
