Clustering methods

Only two implemented for the moment
  - k-means clustering
  - Gaussian mixture solved by EM.
  
        1) Covariance implemented: spherical, diagonal and full
        2) Need to improve probability calculation using log, to be done very shortly as for the Bayes 
           classifiers cases
        3) Still needs some testing
