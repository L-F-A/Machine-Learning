PCA decomposition

In PCA_implementations.py one finds both standard and Kernel PCA

In PCA_Prob.py one finds a working version of probabilistic PCA
    -Not tested at all
    -No calculation of sigÂ² from data yet
    -Does not take care of missing data yet, which is kind of the point
    
  Bottom line: DO NOT try to use it as of now
