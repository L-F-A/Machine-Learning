PCA decomposition

In PCA_implementations.py one finds both standard and Kernel PCA

In PCA_Prob.py one finds an in progress version of probabilistic PCA

  - Not tested at all
  - No calculation of sigÂ² from data yet
  - Does not take care of missing data yet, which is kind of the point
  - Bottom line: DO NOT try to use it (probabilistic PCA) as of now
